# Housing
The website is made for house agency.
Users can see the offered houses, serach and filter the houses.
The users can also make an account on the website.

Every icon in the website is made by me (without the Rotterdam building pciture), and made especially for this website, using photoshop or another tool.
The final version of the website is in folder "Final Website".

The search is work perfectly , you can search houses for rent or for buy
                               you can adjust the price for the search
                               you can enter the house type (house , aprtment or studio)
                               you can select the city of the house.
                               and you can make a combination with those, for example entering just the city and the highest price without the minimum price.


If you go to the "our offer" page, you will get the last 5 house offers entered into the database.

Login - logout work perfectly.

We used OPP for implementing the back-eind, we used our programming OPP knowledge to make the website more professional.
inheritance is used in the website.

We make sure that you can't enter an HTML code in one of the input text, in order to mess up with the website.
